## Introduction

>This project will contain a plugin (or multiple plugins) for use in a [Bukkit](https://bukkit.org/) or [Spigot](http://www.spigotmc.org/) server. The main purpose is to reduce the dependency on other plugins that may be out-of-date or not have enough (or have way too many) features. Specifically designed for a multiworld SMP server with a free world and a protected world.
